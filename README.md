<p># aboutMe<br><br>&gt; For the more information about me you can check also my LinkedIn profile.<br>&gt; * <a data-fr-linked="true" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmetustaa/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmetustaa/</a><br><br><br><br>## My Motto<br><br>&gt; New York is three hours ahead of California, but that doesn&apos;t make California slow.<br><br>&gt; Some graduate at the age of 22 but wait five years to find a solid job. Some become CEOs at 25 and die at 50, while others become CEOs at 50 and live to 90.<br><br>&gt; Some get married and some remain single. Obama retired at 55. Trump took office at 70.<br><br>&gt; Everyone in the whole world lives in **his own time**.<br><br>&gt; Some people around you may seem one step ahead of you, others may seem behind you. But everyone is in their own race, in their own time. Don&apos;t envy them or imitate them. They will live in their time and you will live in yours. **Life is waiting for the right time to act.**<br><br>&gt; **So calm down. You&apos;re not late. It&apos;s not early. You&apos;re right on time.**</p>
